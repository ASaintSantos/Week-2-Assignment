        <h2>Synopsis of Washington State</h2>
        <p>
            Washington, constituent state of the United States of America. Lying at the northwestern corner of the 48 conterminous states, it is bounded by the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north, the U.S. states of Idaho to the east and Oregon to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The capital is Olympia, located at the southern end of Puget Sound in the western part of the state. The stateâ€™s coastal location and excellent harbours give it a leading role in trade with Alaska, Canada, and countries of the Pacific Rim. Washington cities have sister cities in several countries, and their professional and trade associations commonly include Canadian members.

            The terrain and climate of Washington divide the state into a rainy western third and a drier eastern two-thirds in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range. Western Washington industries depend on agriculture, forests, and fisheries and imported raw materials, whereas eastern Washington is mainly agricultural, producing wheat, irrigated crops, and livestock. Most of the people live in the highly urbanized area around Puget Sound that includes Seattle, Everett, Tacoma, and other cities. Area 71,298 square miles (184,661 square km). Pop. (2020) 7,705,281; (2022 est.) 7,785,786.

            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>Native Americans lived in what is now Washington for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. In anthropological terms, the state spans two distinct culture areas, those of the Northwest Coast Indians and the Plateau Indians. Marmes Rock Shelter, in arid eastern Washington, has yielded a 10,000-year sequence of tools left by hunters and gatherers along with some of the oldest well-documented skeletal remains in the Western Hemisphere. The Ozette site, on the Olympic Peninsula, has a unique collection of well-preserved clothing, basketry, and harpoons of people who fished and hunted seals and whales 500 years ago. Tools of a similar culture dating from 2,000 years ago were also found there. These and other sites in the state reflect the diverse cultural forms that evolved after prehistoric migrations from northeastern Asia. In July 1996 human remains believed to date to about 9,400 years ago were discovered near Kennewick; the specimen is known to scientists as Kennewick Man and to Native Americans as the Ancient One. The relationship of Kennewick Man to existing Native American groups is a source of controversy.</p>
            <p>Washington became a State in November 11,1889</p>
